C - Stacks and Queues - LIFO and FIFO

Introduction

This README provides an in-depth understanding of two crucial data structures in C programming: stacks and queues. 
Stacks adhere to the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle, while queues follow the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle.
Mastering these concepts is fundamental for efficient data manipulation and problem-solving in programming.

Stack Definitition

A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, known as the top. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last is the first element to come out. The insertion of an element into the stack is called push operation, and the deletion of an element from the stack is called pop operation. In stack, we always keep track of the last element present in the list with a pointer called top.

Stack Operations
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and retrieve the top element from the stack.

Queue Definition

A queue is another linear data structure where elements are inserted from one end, called the rear, and removed from the other end, known as the front. Queues strictly adhere to the FIFO principle, meaning that the first element inserted is the first to be removed. Key operations in a queue include enqueue, which adds an element, and dequeue, which removes an element. Managing a queue requires two pointers: front and rear.

Queue Operations
Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove and retrieve the front element from the queue.

Conclusion

Comprehending the principles of LIFO for stacks and FIFO for queues is vital for effective programming. These data structures play a pivotal role in managing and processing data, making them invaluable tools for a wide range of programming tasks. By mastering stacks and queues, you'll enhance your problem-solving skills and write more efficient and organized code.
